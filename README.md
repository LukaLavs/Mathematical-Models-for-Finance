# Financial Models for Financial Analysis

This repository contains a collection of **quantitative finance models**. This project is meant as a study of the models and their applications in practice. Perhaps not all the models are coded optimally or correctly. The current models include:

- **Markowitz Portfolio Optimization**
- **Binomial Option Pricing Model (CRR, Jarrow-Rudd, Tian)**
- **Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model**

These models are implemented in Python.
